Started out messing with base-23 arithmetic, but there's not really
any programming needed.

Notice that the smallest pattern that works is "aabcc" (two pairs, and a
sequence of 3 in the middle).

Part 1: cqjxjnds -> cqjxxyzz
          ^^^         ^^^

We want to change least significant digits. In the last five digits,
that means "xj" -> "xx" (cqjxx...) then follow by "yzz"

Part 2: cqjxxyzz -> cqkaabcc
         ^^          ^^

Can't use "jx", need to move further left.  Replace "qj" with "qk". That
leaves five characters, so add the smallest pattern that works, "aabcc"
